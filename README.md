### Overview
Palette Picker is a single-page, full-stack application tbat allows a user to save and amend color palettes. The user experience is meant to be simple and intuitive by means of a top-to-bottom sequence of actions starting with the selection of the palette colors (via random color generation & lock functionality), then moving down through controls for naming saved palettes, and finally arriving at a section for viewing, editing, and deleting cached options. 

The primary focus of the application was to practice the full-circle exercise of authoring backend endpoints and subsequently consuming them to present the user with front-end functionality (and minimal design). Other high-priority emphases included remote collaboration, AGILE methodologies using Github's project management tools, and implementing state management via React hooks.
